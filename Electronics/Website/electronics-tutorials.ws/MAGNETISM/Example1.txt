The amount of flux present in a round magnetic bar was measured at 0.013 webers.
If the material has a diameter of 12cm, calculate the flux density.

    ϕ = 0.013 Wb
    D = 12 cm
    Area = πr² = (3.142) * (0.06²) = 0.0113 m²

        ϕ   0.013
    B = ― = ――――――― = 1.15T 
        A   0.0113
