ELECTROMAGNETISM AROUND A LOOP (Image8.PNG)
The resulting lines of force generated by the current flowing through the loop oppose each other in the space between the two conductors where the two
like poles meet thereby deforming the lines of force around each conductor as shown (Image9.PNG).

However, the distortion(penyimpangan) of the magnetic flux inbetween the two conductors results in an intensity(ukuran atau tingkat kekuatan dari suatu
hal) of the magnetic field at the middle junction were the lines of force become closer together. The resulting interaction between the two like fields
produces a mechanical force between the two conductors as they try to repel away from each other. In an electrical machine this repelling of these two
magnetic fields produces motion.

However, as the conductors cannot move, the two magnetic fields therefore help each other by generating a north and a south pole along this line of
interaction(How? If you look at the Image9.PNG, rotate to 90Â° to the right/left you'll see a magnet). This results in the magnetic field being strongest
in the middle between the two conductors. The intensity of the magnetic field around the conductor is proportional to the distance from the conductor
and by the amount of current flowing through it.

The magnetic field generated around a straight length of current-carrying wire is very weak even with a high current passing through it. However, if
several loops of the wire are wound together along the same axis producing a coil of wire, the resultant magnetic field will become even more 
concentrated and stronger than that of just a single loop. This produces an electromagnetic coil more commonly called a Solenoid.
