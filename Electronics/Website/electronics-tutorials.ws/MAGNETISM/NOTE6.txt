NOTE: 
    if you look at the Image14.PNG, to overcome the residual magnetic density in the soft ferromagnetic material,
    need a slightly less than the hard ferromagnetic. This means it take only small portion of current,I to remove
    the residual magnetic rather than it needs a bigger flow of current to overcome the residual magnetic  

MAGNETIC HYSTERESIS LOOPS FOR SOFT AND HARD MATERIALS (Image14.PNG)
Magnetic Hysteresis results in the dissipation of wasted energy in the form of heat with the energy wasted being in proportion to the area of the magnetic
hysteresis loop. Hysteresis losses will always be a problem in AC transformers where the current is constantly changing direction and thus the magnetic 
poles in the core will cause losses because they constantly reverse direction.

As said previously, the shape of the hysteresis loop depends upon the nature of the iron or steel used and in the case of iron which is subjected(rentan)
to massive reversals of magnetism, for example transformer cores, it is important that the B-H hysteresis loop is as small as possible.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
Electromagnetic induction uses the relationship between electricity and magnetism whereby an electric current flowing through a single wire will produce a
magnetic field around it. If the wire is wound into a coil, the magnetic field is greatly intensified producing a static magnetic field around itself forming
the shape of a bar magnet giving a distinct North and South pole. (Image15.PNG)
