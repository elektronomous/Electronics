An input pin can read a high value when floating because it's susceptible to electrical interference. This can cause the pin to randomly
fluctuate between high and low. 

Explanation
When an input pin is floating, it's not connected to a source, such as Vcc or GND. This makes it vulnerable to electrical noise, such as
thermal noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI). The leads of the chip act like tiny antennas when they are floating. 
This problem can be fixed by using pull up and pull down resistors.

You can use the digitalWrite() function in Arduino IDE to write a digital pin to a HIGH or LOW value. If the pin has been configured as an
OUTPUT with pinMode(), its voltage will be set to the corresponding value.
