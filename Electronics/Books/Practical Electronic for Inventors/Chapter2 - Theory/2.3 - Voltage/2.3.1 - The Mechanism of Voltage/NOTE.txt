To get a mental image of how a battery generates an EMF through a circuit, we envision that chemical
reactions inside yield free electrons that quickly build in number within the negative terminal 
region (anode material), causing an electron concentration. This concentration is full of repulsive 
force (electrons repel) that can be viewed as a kind of “electrical pressure.” With a load (e.g., our
flashlight lamp, conductors, switch) placed between the battery’s terminals, electrons from the 
battery’s negative terminal attempt to alleviate this pressure by dispersing into the circuit. These 
electrons increase the concentration of free electrons within the end of the conductor attached to the
negative terminal. Even a small percentage difference in free electron concentration in one region 
gives rise to great repulsive forces between free electrons. The repulsive force is expressed as a 
seemingly instantaneous (close to the speed of  light) pulse that travels throughout the circuit. 
Those free electrons nearest to the pumped- in electrons are quickly repulsed in the opposite direction;
the next neighboring electrons get shoved, and so on down the line, causing a chain reaction, or pulse.
This pulse travels down the conductor near the speed of light. See Image3.png.

The actual physical movement of electrons is, on average, much slower. In fact, the drift velocity 
(average net velocity of electrons toward the positive terminal) is usually fractions of a millimeter per
second—say, 0.002 mm/s for a 0.1- A current through a 12- gauge wire. We associate this drift movement of
free electrons with current flow or, more precisely, conventional current flow I moving in the opposite 
direction. (As it turns out, the actual motion of electrons is quite complex, involving thermal effects,
too—we’ll go over this in the next section.)

drift velocity is a the average velocity attained by charged particles, such as electrons in a material
due to an EMF force.

It is likely that those electrons farther “down in” the circuit will not feel the same level of repulsive
force, since there may be quite a bit of material in the way which absorbs some of the repulsive energy flow
emanating from the negative terminal (absorbing via electron- electron collisions, free electron–bond 
electron interactions, etc.). And, as you probably know, circuits can contain large numbers of components,
some of which are buried deep within a complex network of pathways. It is possible to imagine that through
some of these pathways the repulsive effects are reduced to a weak nudge(dorongan). We associate these regions
of  “weak nudge” with regions of low "electrical pressure", or voltage. Electrons in these regions have little
potential to do work—they have low potential energy relative to those closer to the source of pumped-in
electrons.

Voltage represents the difference in potential energy. A unit charge has been at one location relative to 
another within a region of “electrical pressure”—the pressure attributed to new free electrons being pumped
into the system. The relationship between the voltage and the difference in potential energy is expressed as:

    Va   = Uab / q
    Vb - Va = (Ub - Ua) / q
    ΔV = ΔU / q

Implicit in the definition of voltage is the notion that voltage is always a measurement between two points, say
point A and point B. That is the reason forthe subscript “AB” in Vab. The symbol ∆V means the same. In many dc 
circuits, people choose the negative terminal of the battery as the 0- V reference, and let everyone know by 
inserting a ground symbol  __|__ (more on this later).

In practice, you rarely see voltages expressed using subscripts (VAB) or deltas (∆V), but instead you simply see 
the symbol V, or you may see a symbol like Vᵣ. The “blank symbol” V, however, is always modified with a phrase 
stating the two points across which the voltage is present. In the second case, Vᵣ, the subscript means that the
voltage is measured across the component ᵣ—in this case, a resistor. (This r is R in, but the math symbol cannot
interpreted it so I used the r instead).
