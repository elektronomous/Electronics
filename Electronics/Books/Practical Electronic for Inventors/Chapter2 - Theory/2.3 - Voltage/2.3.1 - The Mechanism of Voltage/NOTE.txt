To get a mental image of how a battery generates an EMF through a circuit, we envision that chemical
reactions inside yield free electrons that quickly build in number within the negative terminal 
region (anode material), causing an electron concentration. This concentration is full of repulsive 
force (electrons repel) that can be viewed as a kind of “electrical pressure.” With a load (e.g., our
flashlight lamp, conductors, switch) placed between the battery’s terminals, electrons from the 
battery’s negative terminal attempt to alleviate this pressure by dispersing into the circuit. These 
electrons increase the concentration of free electrons within the end of the conductor attached to the
negative terminal. Even a small percentage difference in free electron concentration in one region 
gives rise to great repulsive forces between free electrons. The repulsive force is expressed as a 
seemingly instantaneous (close to the speed of  light) pulse that travels throughout the circuit. 
Those free electrons nearest to the pumped- in electrons are quickly repulsed in the opposite direction;
the next neighboring electrons get shoved, and so on down the line, causing a chain reaction, or pulse.
This pulse travels down the conductor near the speed of light. See Image3.png.

The actual physical movement of electrons is, on average, much slower. In fact, the drift velocity 
(average net velocity of electrons toward the positive terminal) is usually fractions of a millimeter per
second—say, 0.002 mm/s for a 0.1- A current through a 12- gauge wire. We associate this drift movement of
free electrons with current flow or, more precisely, conventional current flow I moving in the opposite 
direction. (As it turns out, the actual motion of electrons is quite complex, involving thermal effects,
too—we’ll go over this in the next section.)

drift velocity is a the average velocity attained by charged particles, such as electrons in a material
due to an EMF force.
(drift velocity is the average velocity with which electrons 'drift'(hanyut / mengalir) in the presence of
electrict field)

It is likely that those electrons farther “down in” the circuit will not feel the same level of repulsive
force, since there may be quite a bit of material in the way which absorbs some of the repulsive energy flow
emanating from the negative terminal (absorbing via electron- electron collisions, free electron–bond 
electron interactions, etc.). And, as you probably know, circuits can contain large numbers of components,
some of which are buried deep within a complex network of pathways. It is possible to imagine that through
some of these pathways the repulsive effects are reduced to a weak nudge(dorongan). We associate these regions
of  “weak nudge” with regions of low "electrical pressure", or voltage. Electrons in these regions have little
potential to do work—they have low potential energy relative to those closer to the source of pumped-in
electrons.

Voltage represents the difference in potential energy. A unit charge has been at one location relative to 
another within a region of “electrical pressure”—the pressure attributed to new free electrons being pumped
into the system. The relationship between the voltage and the difference in potential energy is expressed as:

= How many volt that 1 electron need to move from Ua to Ub ?
  = Now imagine if you place a component (resistor for example) between them? how many volt that 1 electron need
    to move from one of the leg to other leg component ? you'll get it
  = Say that an electrone is in off state in a circuit, then you apply 1 volt to the circuit, in some time the electron
    is move to another point on the circuit, the energy that the electron received after moved from one point to another
    point is the different energy between that points. (do your insight get brighter now?)

    Va   = Uab / q
    Vb - Va = (Ub - Ua) / q

Implicit in the definition of voltage is the notion that voltage is always a measurement between two points, say
point A and point B. That is the reason for the subscript “AB” in Vab. The symbol ∆V means the same. In many dc 
circuits, people choose the negative terminal of the battery as the 0- V reference, and let everyone know by 
inserting a ground symbol  __|__ (more on this later).
                            ---
                             -

In practice, you rarely see voltages expressed using subscripts (VAB) or deltas (∆V), but instead you simply see 
the symbol V, or you may see a symbol like Vᵣ. The “blank symbol” V, however, is always modified with a phrase 
stating the two points across which the voltage is present. In the second case, Vᵣ, the subscript means that the
voltage is measured across the component ᵣ—in this case, a resistor. (This r is R in, but the math symbol cannot
interpreted it so I used the r instead).

In our flashlight example, we can calculate the difference in potential energy between an electron emanating from
the negative terminal of the 1.5- V battery and one entering the positive terminal:

    ΔU = ΔVq = (1.5 V)(1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 2.4 x 10⁻¹⁹ J

Notice that this result gives us the potential energy difference between the two electrons, not the actual potential
energy of either the electron emanating from the negative terminal (U1) or the electron entering the positive 
terminal (U0). However, if we make the assumption that the electron entering the positive terminal is at zero 
potential energy, we can figure that the electron emanating from the negative terminal has a relative potential 
energy of:

    U₁ = ΔU + U₀ = ΔU + 0 = 2.4 x 10⁻¹⁹ J

In a real circuit, where the number of electrons pumped out by the battery will be quite large—hundreds to thousands
of trillions of electrons, depending on the resistance to electron flow—we must multiply our previous calculation by
the total number of entering electrons. For example, if our flashlight draws 0.1 A :

    1 A = 1 C = 6.24 x 10¹⁸ e/p
    0.1 A = 0.1 C = 6.24 x 10¹⁷ e/p

there will be 6.24 x 10¹⁷ electrons pumped into it by the battery per second, so you calculate the potential energy of
all the new electrons together to be about:
    
    ΔU = ΔVq = (1.5 V) (0.1 C) = 0.15 J/s

we assume all electrons within the same conductor have the same potential energy. This assumes that there is no voltage
difference between points in the same conductor. For example, if you take a voltmeter and place it between any two 
points of a single conductor, it will measure 0 V. (See Fig. 2.8.) For practical purposes, we accept this as true. 
However, in reality it isn’t. There is a slight voltage drop through a conductor, and if we had a voltmeter that was
extremely accurate we might measure a voltage drop of 0.00001 V or so, depending on the length of the conductor, current
flow, and conductor material type. This is attributed to internal resistance within conductors—a topic we’ll cover in a
moment.
