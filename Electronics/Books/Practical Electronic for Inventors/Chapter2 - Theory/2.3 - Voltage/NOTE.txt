To get electrical current to flow from one point to another, a voltage must exist between the
two points. A voltage placed across a conductor gives rise to an electromotive force (EMF)
that is responsible for giving all free electrons within the conductor a push.

voltage is also referred to as a potential difference or just potential—they all mean the same
thing. We’ll avoid using these terms, however, because it is easy to confuse them with the term
potential energy, which is not the same thing.

rest of the circuit needs the battery. Without the linkage between its terminals, the chemical 
reactions within the battery cannot be carried out. These chemical reactions involve the transfer
of electrons(Image2.png), which by intended design can only occur through a link between the
battery’s terminals (e.g., where the circuit goes).

As free electrons within the lamp filament experience an EMF due to the applied voltage, the extra
energy they gain is transferred to the filament lattice atoms, which result in heat (filament 
atomic vibrations) and emitted light (when a valence electron of a lattice atom is excited by a 
free electron and the bound electron returns to a lower energy configuration, thus releasing a 
photon).

A device that maintains a constant voltage across it terminals is called a direct current voltage
source (or dc voltage source). A battery is an example of a dc voltage source. The schematic symbol
for a battery is |∣|∣.
