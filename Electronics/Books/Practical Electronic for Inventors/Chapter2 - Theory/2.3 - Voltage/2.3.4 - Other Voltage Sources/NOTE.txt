There are other mechanisms besides the chemical reactions within batteries that give rise to an
electromotive force that pushes electrons through circuits. Some examples include magnetic 
induction, photovoltaic action, thermoelectric effect, piezoelectric effect, and static
electric effect. 

Magnetic induction (used in electrical generators) and photovoltaic action (used in photocells),
along with chemical reactions, are, however, the only mechanisms of those listed that provide 
enough power to drive most circuits.
