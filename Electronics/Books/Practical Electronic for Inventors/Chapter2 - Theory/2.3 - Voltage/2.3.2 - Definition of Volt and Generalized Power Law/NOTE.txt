    1 Volt = 1 Joule / 1 Coulomb = J/C (Energy Definition)

To move 1 Coulumb, I need 1 Joule of energy that is can be generated by 1 Volt.

Two points with a voltage of 1 V between them have enough “pressure” to perform 1 J worth of work while 
moving 1 C worth of charge between the points. For example, an ideal 1.5- V battery is capable of moving
1 C of charge through a circuit while performing 1.5 J worth of work.

Power represents how much energy per second goes into powering a circuit. According to the conservation
of energy, we can say the power used to drive a circuit must equal the power used by the circuit to do
useful work plus the power wasted, as in the case of heat. 

By definition, power is mathematically expressed as dW/dt. If we substitute the potential energy 
expression U = Vq for W, assuming the voltage is constant (e.g., battery voltage), we get the following:

        P = dW / dt = dU / dt = V (dq / dt)

Since we know that current I = dq/dt, we can substitute this into the preceding expression to get:

        P = VI

= How long that volt is used to bring the electron from one point to another point. (Watts)

This is referred to as the generalized power law. This law is incredibly powerful, and it provides a 
general result, one that is independent of type of material and of the nature of the charge movement. The
unit of this electrical power is watts (W), with 

        1 W = 1 J/s, 

= It's use 1 Joule of energy in 1 second to bring the electrons from one point to another.

or in terms of volts and amps,
        
        1 W = 1 VA.

In terms of power, then, the volt is defined as:    

        1 volt = 1 watt / 1 amp
        1 v = 1 W / 1 A = W / A 

= using 1 volt, you can generate power 1 watt that could be use to move the 1 A.
