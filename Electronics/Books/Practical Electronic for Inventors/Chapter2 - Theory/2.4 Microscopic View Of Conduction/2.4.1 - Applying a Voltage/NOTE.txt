Next, we wish to see what happens when we apply a voltage across the conductor—say, by attaching
a thick copper wire across a battery. When we do this, our randomly moving  free electrons all
experience a force pointing toward the positive end of the wire due to the electric field set up
within the wire. The actual influence this force has on the motion(gerakan) of the random free 
electrons is small—the thermal velocity is so  large that it is difficult to change the momentum
of the electrons. What you get is a slightly parabolic deviation in path, as shown in Fig. 2.16

Due to drift velocity of electrons current is flown from a conductor ( consider of. Length 'l' and cross section area 'a' ) then if we take one electron at one side of the conductor then it will move opposite to the electric field i.e from -ve to +ve in a single cell closed circuit with a constant acceleration qe/m where q and e are mass and charge of electron and e is magnitude of electric field
Now applying laws of motion
S =1/2 a t^2 since u =0 and a= qe / m and s=v*t Where v is drift velocity
also I=nqav
where v - drift velocity/ q - charge /a - area of cross section / v - drift velocity / I - current
so increase in temperature increase in I so electron collides more with positive lattice inside a conductor so we can also say that resistance of conductor increases with increment in temperature
