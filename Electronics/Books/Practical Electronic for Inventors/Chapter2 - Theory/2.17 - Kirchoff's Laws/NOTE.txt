Often, you will run across a circuit that cannot be analyzed with simple resistor circuit reduction techniques
alone. Even if you could find the equivalent resistance by using circuit reduction, it might not be possible for
you to find the individual currents and voltage through and across the components within the network. 

Kirchhoff’s laws provide the most general method for analyzing circuits. These laws work for either linear 
(resistor, capacitors, and inductors) or nonlinear elements (diodes, transistors, etc.), no matter how complex the
circuit gets. Kirchhoff’s two laws are stated as follows.

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (or Loop Rule): The algebraic sum of the voltages around any loop of a circuit is zero:
    ⎲
    ⎳  ∆V = V₁ + V₂ + V.. + Vₙ = 0

To show how Kirchhoff’s voltage law works, we consider the circuit in Image1.PNG. We start anywhere we like along the
circuit path—say, at the negative terminal of the 5-V battery. Then we start making a loop trace, which in this case
we choose to go clockwise, though it doesn’t really matter which direction you choose. Each time we encounter a circuit
element, we add it to what we’ll call our ongoing loop equation. To determine the sign of the voltage difference, we
apply the loop trace rules shown in the shaded section of the Image1.PNG. We continue adding elements until we make it 
back to the start of the loop, at which point we terminate the loop equation with an “= 0.”

Kirchhoff’s Current Law (or Junction Rule): The sum of the currents that enter a junction equals the sum of the 
currents that leave the junction:

    ⎲       ⎲
    ⎳ Iᵢₙ =  ⎳ Iₒᵤₜ

The following example shows both Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws in action.

Example: By applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the following circuit(Image2.PNG), find all the unknown currents, I₁, I₂, I₃, 
I₄, I₅, I₆, assuming that R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅, R₆, and V₀ are known. After that, the voltage drops across the resistors 
V₁, V₂, V₃, V₄, V₅, and V₆ can be found using Ohm’s law: Vₙ = IₙRₙ.

Answer: To solve this problem, you apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to enough closed loops and apply Kirchhoff’s current law
to enough junctions that you end up with enough equations to counterbalance the unknowns. After that, it is simply a matter
of doing some algebra. Image3.PNG illustrates how to apply the laws in order to set up the final equations.

A third method that we think is useful—practically speaking—involves using a trick with determinants and Cramer’s rule. The 
neat thing about this trick is that you do not have to know any math—that is, if you have a mathematical computer program or
calculator that can do determinants. The only requirement is that you be able to plug numbers into a grid (determinant) and
press “equals.” We do not want to spend too much time on this technique, so we will simply provide you with the equations and
use the equations to find one of the solutions to the resistor circuit problem.

For example, you can find ∆ for the system of equations from the resistor problem by plugging all the coefficients into the
determinant and pressing the “evaluate” button on the calculator or computer.

        I₁ = I₂ + I₃ => I₁ - I₂ - I₃ = 0 =>      | 1    -1    -1    0    0    0  |
        I₂ = I₅ + I₄ => I₂ - I₅ - I₄ = 0 =>      | 0     1     0   -1   -1    0  |
        I₆ = I₃ + I₄ => I₆ - I₃ - I₄ = 0 =>      | 0     0    -1   -1    0    1  |
V₀ - I₁R₁ - I₂R₂ - I₅R₅ => I₁ + 2I₂ + 5I₅ = 10   | 1     2     0    0    5    0  | = -587
   - I₃R₃ + I₄R₄ + I₂R₂ => -3I₃ + 4I₄ + 2I₂ = 0  | 0     2    -3    4    0    0  |
   - I₆R₆ + I₅R₅ - I₄R₄ => -6I₆ + 5I₅ - 4I₄ = 0  | 0     0     0   -4    5   -6  | 

Now, to find, say, the current through R₅ and the voltage across it, you find ∆I₅, then use I₅ = ∆I₅/∆ to find the current. 
Then you use Ohm’s law to find the voltage.
