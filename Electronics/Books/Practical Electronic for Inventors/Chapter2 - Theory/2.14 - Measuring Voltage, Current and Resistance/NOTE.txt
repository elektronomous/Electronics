In theory, an ideal voltmeter should draw no current as it measures a voltage between two points in a
circuit; it has infinite input resistance Rᵢₙ. Likewise, an ideal ammeter should introduce no voltage
drop when it is placed in series within the circuit; it has zero input resistance. An ideal ohmmeter
should provide no additional resistance when making a resistance measurement.

Real meters, on the other hand, have limitations that prevent them from making truly accurate measurements.
This stems from the fact that the circuit of a meter requires a sample current from the circuit under test
in order to make a display measurement. Image1.PNG shows symbols for an ideal voltmeter, ammeter, and ohmmeter,
along with the more accurate real- life equivalent circuits.

The effects of meter internal resistance are shown in Image2.PNG. In each case, the internal resistance becomes
part of the circuit. The percentages of error in measurements due to the internal resistances become more
pronounced when the circuit resistances approach the meters’ internal resistance.

Image3.PNG shows the actual makeup of a basic analog multimeter. Note that this device is overly simplistic; real
meters are much more sophisticated, with provisions for range selection, ac measurements, and so on. At any rate,
it shows you that the meters are nonideal due to the sample current required to drive the galvanometer’s needle.
