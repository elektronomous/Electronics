What is the microscopic explanation for these (Image1 and Image2 in 2.5.2) differences?
The answer to this question rests upon the quantum nature of electrons. In classical physics
the energy of an electron in a metal can take on any value—it is said the energy values form a
continuum. (Here, electron energy is considered zero at infinite distance from the nucleus and
becomes more negative in energy closer to the nucleus, relative to the zero reference state. 
Negative energy infers that there is electric attraction between the positive nucleus and the
electron—it is electric potential energy.)
