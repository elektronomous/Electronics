You have a 10- V supply, but a device that is to be connected to the supply
is rated at 3 V and draws 9.1 mA. Create a voltage divider for the load device.

(answer):

In this case, the load draws current and can be considered a resistor in parallel with R2.
Therefore, using the voltage divider relation without taking the load into consideration 
will not work. We must apply what is called the 10 percent rule.

*If you wonder what does the load draws current means, it's load that need a current for N amperes.
 Take a look at the problem that the load need 9.1 mA (draws) and 3 volt. Why does the load need that
 volt and the current, because to get the load works, it needs that current and the voltage.

The 10 Percent Rule: This rule is a standard method for selecting R1 and R2 that takes into account
the load and minimizes unnecessary power losses in the divider. The first thing you do is select R2 
so that I₂ is 10 percent of the desired load current. This resistance and current are called the bleeder
resistance and bleeder current. The bleeder current in our example is:

        I_bleed = I₂ = (0.10)(9.1 mA) = 0.91 mA 

Using Ohm's law, next we calculate the bleeder resistance:

        R_bleed = R₂ = 3 V / 0.91 mA = 3297 Ω 

Considering resistor tolerances and standard resistance values, we select a resistor in close vicinity—3300 Ω.

Next, we need to select R1, so that the output is maintained at 3 V. To do this, simply calculate the total current
through the resistor and use Ohm’s law:

        I₁ = I₂ + I_load = 0.91 + 9.1 = 10.01 mA = 0.01 A
    
        R₁ = V₁ / I₁ = (Vₜₒₜ - V₂) / I₁ = 7 V / 0.01 A = 700 Ω

In terms of power ratings:

        P_R₁ = V₁² / R₁ = (7V)² / (700 Ω) = 0.07 W = 70 mW
        P_R₂ = V₂² / R₂ = (3V)² / (3300 Ω) = 0.003 W = 3 mW

Low- power ¼- W resistors will suffice.
