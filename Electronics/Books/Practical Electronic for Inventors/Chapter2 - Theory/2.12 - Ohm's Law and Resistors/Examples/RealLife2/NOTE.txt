I have a blue LED and a green LED. The blue one needs 5V and 30 mA and the green needs
2.5V and 25 mA.

(answer):

V_blue = 5 Volts 
I_blue = 30 mA

V_green = 2.5 Volts
I_green = 25 mA 

first calculate all the total current

    Iₜₒₜₐₗ = I_blue + I_green = 30 + 25 = 55 mA

and from this, you get the I_bleeder from the 10 percent of this total

    I_bleeder = Iₜₒₜₐₗ * 10% = 5,5 mA

and to get the R₃ (which is parallel with green LED, the voltage must be same), use Ohm's law:

    R_bleeder = R₃ = V_green / I_bleeder = 2.5 V / 5,5 mA = 450 Ω

to give the green LED 25 mA and the 5,5 mA, we need to calculate the R₂ :

    I_R₂ = I_R₃ + I_green = 25 + 5,5 = 30,5 mA 

because blue LED parallel with the load R₃ and green LED, we don't give them the whole blue LED's
voltages, so we decrease it by placing the resistor R₂ series with R₃:

    R₂ = V_blue / I_R₂ = (5 - 2,5) Volts / 30,5 mA = 81 Ω

using R₂ 81 Ω and 2,5 volts we can give the R₃ and green LED a 2,5 volts and 30,5 mA (whichs divided again
by the size of both component). To give blue LED a 5 volts and 30 mA, the R₁ need to find out: 

    I_R₁ = I_R₂ + I_green = 30,5 mA + 30 mA = 60,5 mA 

I have 9 volt battery, we need to give the R₂ and the green LED 5 volts, so we get left:

    V_R₁ = Vbat - V_green = (9 - 5) = 4 volts

from this we can get the size of R₁ :

    R₁ = V_R₁ / I_R₁ = 4 volts / 60,5 mA = 66 Ω

recalculate this when you found the real resistor's value: 

R₃ = 470 Ω
R₂ = 100 Ω
R₁ = 75 Ω

Rₜₒₜ = 645 Ω
Iₜₒₜ = Vbat / 645 = 0,013 A = 13 mA
