I have a blue LED and a green LED. The blue one needs 5V and 30 mA and the green needs
2.5V and 25 mA. Considered that you supplied by the 10V source battery

(answer):

the first resistor (top-most resistor) = R₁
the middle resistor = R₂
the bottom resistor = R₃ 

V_blue = 5 Volts 
I_blue = 30 mA

V_green = 2.5 Volts
I_green = 25 mA 

If you arrange both LED in series, their current must be the same. You can arrange both LED like the one
circuit in 2.12.5 - Multiple Voltage Divider. The previous of this calculation is incorrect so I choose
to updated. 

first you need to account the bleeder current which is 10% of the total current

    I_bleeder = I_R₃ = (I_blue + I_green) × 10% = (30 mA + 25 mA) × 10% = 5,5 mA

now you account for the R₃

           V_R₃         2.5 V 
    R₃ = ―――――――――― = ―――――――――― = 454,5 Ω 
         I_bleeder      5,5 mA 

Now the total current (I_R₃ + I_green) needed so we can count for the R₂ 

    I_R₃gᵣₑₑₙ = I_bleeder + I_green = 25 mA + 5,5 mA = 30,5 mA 

Now if you want to calculate the R₂, you need the V_R₂. Because there's no V_R₂ you can get the V_R₂ by

    V_blue = V_green + V_R₂
    V_R₂ = V_blue - V_green = 5 V - 2,5 V = 2,5 V

now you can calculate for the R₂

           V_R₂       2,5 V
    R₂ = ――――――――― = ―――――――――― = 82 Ω
         I_R₃gᵣₑₑₙ    30,5 mA 

Now the total current (I_R₂ + I_blue) needed so we can count for the R₁

    I_R₂bₗᵤₑ = I_R₂ + I_blue = 30,5 mA + 30 mA = 60,5 mA

Also you don't know the V_R₁, like finding the V_R₂ the V_R₁ exactly the same
    
    V_battery = V_R₁ + V_green
    V_R₁ = V_battery - V_green = 10 V - 5 V = 5 V

Now you can find the R₁

          V_R₁      5 V
    R₁ = ――――――― = ―――――――― = 83 Ω
         I_R₂bₗᵤₑ   60,5 mA
