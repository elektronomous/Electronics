You have a 10- V supply, but two LEDs supply are rated at:
 (1) LED₁ 3,5 V and draws 20 mA
 (2) LED₂ 2 V and draws 20mA
Create a voltage divider for the load device.

= When you arrange the LEDs like the one above, you need to make sure that those two LEDs have the same
  current rate operation. Why ? Because in series, the total current is same all around the components. 
  That's why if you have two LEDs and operated at the different level of current, the load that's rated
  lower will have resistor that's not efficient in power consumption. The rule of 10 percent is a standard 
  method for selecting resistor that takes into account the load and minimizes unnecessary power losses
  in the divider

- first you need to take the 10percent of the current of the LED₂, this called current bleeder:
  
    I_bleeder_LED₂ = 20 mA × 10% = 2 mA

- with the current you get, you can now account for the R₃ here to be attach with the LED₂, this called
  resistor bleeder:
    
    R₃ = R_bleeder = V_LED₂ / I_bleeder_LED₂ = 2 V / 2 mA = 1000 Ω

- Now when you combine the two current (bleeder and the LED₂), you get the total of the current:

    Iₜₒₜₐₗ = I_bleeder_LED₂ + I_LED₂ = 20 mA + 2 mA = 22 mA

- Because LED₁ operated in the same current level, we also can get the bleeder current for the LED₁ with
  the same amount as LED₂:
    
    I_bleeder_LED₁ = 20 mA x 10% = 2 mA

- R₂ now can be account as the current bleeder is there:

    R₂ = R_bleeder = V_LED₁ / I_bleeder_LED₁ = 3,5 V / 2 mA = 1750 Ω

- remember in series each load can have variable voltage, but the same current all accross the loads
- We have 10 V suply, we have used 

    V_used = V_LED₁ + V_LED₂ = 3,5 V + 2 V = 5,5 V

- the left voltage we have is:
    
    V_left = Vₜₒₜₐₗ - V_used = 10 V - 5,5 V = 4,5 V

- Because current in the first load (R₁) is the same as the Iₜₒₜₐₗ, and we have left voltage we can now
  account for the R₁:
    
    R₁ = V_left / Iₜₒₜₐₗ = 4,5 V / 22 mA = 204,5 Ω
