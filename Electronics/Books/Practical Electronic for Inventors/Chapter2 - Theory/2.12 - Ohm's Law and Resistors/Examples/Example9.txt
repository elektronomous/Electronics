The input of an IC requires a constant 5 V, but the supply voltage is 9 V. Use the
voltage divider equations to create a voltage divider with an output of 5 V. Assume
the IC has such a high input resistance (10 MΩ) that it practically draws no current
from the divider.

(answer):
Since we assume the IC draws no current, we can apply the voltage divider directly:

                 R₂
    Vₒᵤₜ = Vᵢₙ ―――――――――――
               R₁ + R₂ 


We must choose voltage divider resistors, making sure our choice doesn’t draw too much current,
causing unnecessary power loss. To keep things simple for now, let’s choose R₂ to be 10 kΩ. 
Rearranging the voltage divider and solving for R₁:


    Vₒᵤₜ (R₁ + R₂) = Vᵢₙ R₂
    Vₒᵤₜ R₁ + Vₒᵤₜ R₂ = Vᵢₙ R₂
    Vₒᵤₜ R₁ = Vᵢₙ R₂ - Vₒᵤₜ R₂

              
              (Vᵢₙ - Vₒᵤₜ)
    R₁ = R₂  ――――――――――――――
                Vₒᵤₜ


                (9 - 5)
    R₁ = 10K ――――――――――――
                5
    
       = 40000 / 5 = 8000 Ω

Now you're going to put the IC parallel with R₂, not with R₁.. why ?
if you calculate the Iₜₒₜₐₗ, you'll end up with V₁ is 4 Volt and 5 Volt
in V₂
