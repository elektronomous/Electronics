Example: In Example1.PNG, a 100-Ω resistor is placed across a 12- V battery. How much current 
flows through the resistor? How much power does the resistor dissipate?

(answer):

    R = 100-Ω
    V = 12 V
    I = ? 

    I = V / R = 12 / 100 = 12 x 10⁻² A = 120 mA 
    P = I²R = (12 x 10⁻²)²(100) = 144 x 10⁻⁴ * (100) = 1,44 W
