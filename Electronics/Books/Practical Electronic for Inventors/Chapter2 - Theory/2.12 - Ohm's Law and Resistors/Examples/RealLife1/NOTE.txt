RED LED forward voltage = 1.6 - 2.6 Volts 
        maximum current = 30 mA 

Say Iam using 9 volt battery to power the LED.png:

Using the 10 percent rule:

Search for the current bleed first

        I_bleed = I₂ = (0.1) (0,03) = 3 mA

and the resistor bleed:

        R_bleed = R₂ = V_LED / I₂ = 2.6 / 0,03 mA = 86 Ω

We can use the 100 Ω for the R_bleed
and now to maintain the 2.6 volts, the R₁ must be: 


        I₁ = I₂ + I_LED = 3 + 30 = 33 mA = 0,033 A

        R₁ = V₁ / I₁ = (Vbat - Vload) / I₁ = (9 - 3) / 0,033 = 181 Ω

from this we can use 220 Ω for the R₁

recomputed after you get all the bleeders and the remaining resistors 

You can see the picture of the result in Result.PNG
