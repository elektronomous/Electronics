Determining how much power a resistor dissipates is very important when designing circuits. All real
resistors have maximum allowable power ratings that must not be exceeded. If you exceed the power 
rating, you’ll probably end up frying your resistor, destroying the internal structure, and thus 
altering the resistance. Typical general- purpose resistors come in 1⁄8- , 1⁄4- , 1⁄2- , and 1- W 
power ratings, while high- power resistors can range from 2 to several hundred watts.

So, in the preceding example(Examples -> Example1.txt), where our resistor was dissipating 1.44 W, 
we should have made sure that our resistor’s power rating exceeded 1.44 W; otherwise, there could be
smoke. As a rule of thumb, always select a resistor that has a power rating at least twice the maximum
value anticipated. Though a 2- W resistor would work in our example, a 3- W resistor would be safer.

To illustrate how important power ratings are, we examine the circuit shown in Image1.PNG. The resistance
is variable, while the supply voltage is fixed at 5 V. As the resistance increases, the current decreases,
and according to the power law, the power decreases, as shown in the graphs. As the resistance decreases,
the current and power increase. The far right graph shows that as you decrease the resistance, the power
rating of the resistor must increase; otherwise, you’ll burn up the resistor.
