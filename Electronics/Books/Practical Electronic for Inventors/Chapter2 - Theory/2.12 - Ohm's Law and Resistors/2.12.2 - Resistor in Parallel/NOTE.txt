When two or more resistors are placed in parallel, the voltage across each resistor
is the same, but the current through each resistor will vary with resistance. Also, the
total resistance of the combination will be lower than that of the lowest resistance
value present. The formula for finding the total resistance of resistors in parallel is:

                            1
    Rₜₒₜₐₗ = ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
           1      1      1     1
          ―――― + ―――― + ―――― + ―――― + . . .   
           R₁     R₂     R₃    R₄
    

            R₁ x R₂
    Rₜₒₜₐₗ = ―――――――――――
            R₁ + R₂

The dots in the equation indicate that any number of resistors can be combined. You can derive
the resistor- in- parallel formula by noting that the sum of the individual branch currents is equal
to the total current: 
        
        Iₜₒₜₐₗ = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ + … Iₙ

This is referred to as Kirchhoff’s current law. Then, applying Ohm’s law, we get: 
        
        Iₜₒₜₐₗ = V₁/R₁ + V₂/R₂ + V₃/R₃ + … Vₙ/Rₙ

Because all resistor voltages are equal to Vₜₒₜₐₗ since they share the same voltage across them, we get:
        
        Iₜₒₜₐₗ = Vₜₒₜₐₗ/R₁ + Vₜₒₜₐₗ/R₂ + Vₜₒₜₐₗ/R₃ + … Vₜₒₜₐₗ/Rₙ 

Factoring out Vₜₒₜₐₗ, we get: 
        
        Iₜₒₜₐₗ = Vₜₒₜₐₗ (1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ … 1/R₄ )

We call the term in brackets Rₜₒₜₐₗ.


Note that there is a shorthand for saying that two resistors are in parallel. The shorthand is 
to use double bars | | to indicate resistors in parallel. So to say R₁ is in parallel with R₂, you
would write R₁ | | R₂. Thus, you can express two resistors in parallel in the following ways:

                           1            R₁ x R₂
        R₁ || R₂ =  ―――――――――――――――  = ―――――――――――――――
                    1 / R₁ + 1 / R₂     R₁ + R₂ 


In terms of arithmetic order of operation, the || can be treated similar to multiplication or division.
For example, in the equation Zin = R1 + R2 | | Rload, you calculate R2 and Rload in parallel first, and
then you add R1.

This statement is referred to as Kirchhoff’s current law. With this law, and Ohm’s law, you come up with
the current divider equations, show at the bottom of Image1.PNG. These equations come in handy when you
know the input current but not the input voltage
