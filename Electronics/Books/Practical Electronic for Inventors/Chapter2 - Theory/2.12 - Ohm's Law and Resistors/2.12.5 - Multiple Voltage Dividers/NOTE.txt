You wish to create a multiple voltage divider that powers three loads:
load 1 (75 V, 30 mA), 
load 2 (50 V, 10 mA), and 
load 3 (25 V, 10 mA). 
Use the 10 percent rule and Image1.PNG to construct the voltage divider.

(answer):
I_R₃ means current that flow through Resistor 3.


An important point in determining the resistor when applying the 10 percent rule of thumb is that to
calculate the bleeder current, you must take 10 percent of the total load current. The steps are as follows:

Find the bleeder current, which is 10 percent(0.1) of the total current:

    I_R₄ = I₄ = 0.1 x (10 mA + 10mA + 30mA) = 5 mA

To find R₄ (bleeder resistor), use Ohm's law: 

    R₄ = (V_load₃ - 0) / I₄ = 25 V / 0.005 = 5000 Ω

Why do we use V_load₃ ? Because V_load₃ is the same with Voltage on R₄
The current through R₃ is equal to the current through R₄ plus the current through load₃:

    I_R₃ = I_R₄ + I_Rload = 5 mA + 10 mA = 15 mA 

To find R₃, use Ohm's law, using the voltage difference between load₂ and load₃:

    R₃ = V_R₃ / I₃ = (V_load₂ - V_load₃) / I₃ = (50 - 25) / 15 mA = 1666 Ω

If you wonder why V_R₃ = V_load₂ - V_load₃ ? V_R₃₄ is the total of V_R₃ added by V_load₃ (V_R₃₄ = V_R₃ + V_load₃). You know that
V_R₃₄ is the same as V_load₂ and the total current that is enter to the V_R₃₄ is 15 mA. You don't know the V_R₃, that's why you need
the linear algebra to solve it. 

    V_R₃ = V_R₃₄ - V_load₃
    V_R₃ = V_load₂ - V_load₃ .....

The current through R₂ is:

    I_R₂ = I_R₃ + I_load₂ = 15 mA + 10 mA = 25 mA

to find R₂, use Ohm's law, using the voltage difference between load₁ and load₂:

    R₂ = V_R₂ / I_R₂ = (75 - 50) / 25 mA = 1000 Ω 

The current through R1:

    I_R₁ = I_R₂ + I_Load₁ = 25 mA + 30 mA = 55 mA

to find R₁, use Ohm's law, using the voltage difference between the whole voltage and the load₁:
    
    R₁ = V_R₁ / I₁ = (100 - 75) / 55 mA = 25 / 55 mA = 455 Ω


For example, the voltage divider in Image2 is designed to provide the voltage and current to three loads from a given 
source voltage:
    Load 1: +50 V @ 50 mA
    Load 2: +25 V @ 10 mA
    Load 3: −25 V @ 100 mA

The values of R4, R2, and R1 are computed exactly as was done in the preceding example. IR4 is the bleeder current and
can be calculated as follows: 

    I_R₄ = 10% × (Iload1 + Iload2 + Iload3) = 16 mA

Calculating R4:
    
    R₄ = 25 V/0.016 A = 1562 Ω  

To calculate current through R3, use Kirchhoff’s current law (at point A):
    
    I_R₃ + Iload2 + Iload1 + I_R₄ + Iload3 = 0
    I_R₃ + 10 mA + 50mA - 16mA - 100 mA = 0
    I_R₃ - 56mA 
    I_R₃ = 56mA

Calculating R₃ : R₃ = V_load₂ / I_R₃ = (25 V) / 0.056 A = 446 Ω.
Calculating I_R₂ : I_R₂ = I_R₃ + I_load₂ = 56 mA + 10 mA = 66 mA
Calculating R₂ : R₂ = (V_load₁ - V_load₂) / I_R₂ = 25 V / 0.066 A = 379 Ω
Calculating I_R₁ : I_R₁ = I_R₂ + I_Load₁ = 66 mA + 50 mA = 116 mA 
then R₁ = (Vleft) / I_R₁ = (25 V) / (0.116 A) = 216 Ω

Though voltage dividers are simple to apply, they are not regulated in any way. If a load’s resistance changes, or if there is 
variation in the supply voltage, all loads will experience a change in voltage. Therefore, voltage dividers should not be applied to
circuits where the divider will be weighed down by changes in load. For applications that require steady voltage and that draw 
considerable current, it is best to use an active device, such as a voltage regulator IC—more on this later.
