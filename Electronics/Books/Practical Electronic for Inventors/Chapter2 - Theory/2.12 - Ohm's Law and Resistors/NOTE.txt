Resistors are devices used in circuits to limit current flow or to set voltage levels within
circuits. Image1.PNG shows the schematic symbol for a resistor; two different forms are commonly
used. Schematic symbols for variable resistors—resistors that have a manually adjustable 
resistance, as well as a model of a real- life resistor, are also shown. (The real- life model
becomes important later on when we deal with highfrequency ac applications. For now, ignore the model.)

If a dc voltage is applied across a resistor, the amount of current that will flow through the 
resistor can be found using Ohm’s law. To find the power dissipated as heat by the resistor, the
generalized power (with Ohm’s law substitution) can be used.

        V = I x R                   (2.15) Ohm's law
        P = VI = V² / R = I²R       (2.16) Ohm's Power Law

R is the resistance or the resistor expressed in ohms (Ω), P is the power loss in watts
(W), V is the voltage in volts (V), and I is the current in amperes (A).

UNIT PREFIXES
a 100,000-Ω resistance can be simplified by writing 100 kΩ (or simply 100k, for short). Here 
k = ×1000. A 2,000,000-Ω resistance can be shortened to 2 MΩ (or 2M, for short). Here M = ×1,000,000.

Conversely, voltages, currents, and power levels are usually small fractions of a unit, in which case
it is often easier to use unit prefixes such as 
    m (milli or ×10⁻³), 
    µ (micro or × 10−⁶), 
    n (nano or ×10−⁹),

or even 

    p (pico or ×10−¹²). 

For example, a current of 0.0000594 A (5.94 × 10−⁵ A) can be written in unit prefix form as 59.4 µA.
A voltage of 0.0035 (3.5 × 10−³ V) can be written in unit prefix form as 3.5 mV. A power of 0.166 W can
be written in unit prefix form as 166 mW.
