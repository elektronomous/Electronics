When a circuit has a number of resistors connected in series, the total resistance of the
circuit is the sum of the individual resistances. Also, the amount of current flowing
through each resistor in series is the same, while the voltage across each resistor varies
with resistance. The formula for finding the total resistance of resistors in series is:

        Rₜₒₜₐₗ = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + R₄ + ...

The dots indicate that as many resistors as necessary may be added. You can derive this 
formula by noting that the sum of all the voltage drops across each series resistor will
equal the applied voltage across the combination 

    Vₜₒₜₐₗ = V₁ + V₂ + V₃ + … + Vₙ . 

This is referred to as Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Applying Ohm’s law, and noting that the same
current I flows through each resistor, we get: 

    IRₜₒₜₐₗ = IR₁  + IR₂ + IR₃ + … + IRₙ

Canceling the I’s you get: 
    
    Rₜₒₜₐₗ = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + R₄ + …

When these series resistors are placed in series with a battery, as shown in Image1.PNG, the
total current flow I is simply equal to the applied voltage Vin, divided by the total 
resistance: (Say that we've got 9V battery, refers to Example8.txt):

          Vᵢₙ           9
    I = ―――――――― = ――――――――――― = 0,003 A = 3 mA  
          Rₜₒₜₐₗ        3000

Since the circuit is a series circuit, the currents through each resistor are equal to
the total current I:

    I₁ = 3 mA, I₂ = 3 mA 

To find the voltage drop across each resistor, apply Ohm’s law:

    V₁ = I₁R₁ = 0.003 A x 1000 Ω = 3 V
    V₂ = I₂R₂ = 0.003 A x 2000 Ω = 6 V 

Now, we didn’t really have to calculate the current. We could have just plugged 
    
    I = Vᵢₙ / Rₜₒₜ 

into I₁ and I₂ in the preceding equations and got: 

                   Vᵢₙ
    V₁ = IR₁ = ――――――――――― x R₁
                 R₁ + R₂ 


                    Vᵢₙ
    V₂ = IR₂ = ―――――――――――― x R₂
                  R₁ + R₂ 

These equations are called voltage divider equations and are so useful in electronics that
it is worth memorizing them. (See Image1.PNG.) Often V₂ is called the output voltage Vₒᵤₜ .

The voltage drop across each resistor is directly proportional to the resistance. The voltage
drop across the 2000-Ω resistor is twice as large as that of the 1000-Ω resistor. Adding both
voltage drops together gives you the applied voltage of 9 V:

    Vᵢₙ = V₁ + V₂ 

    9 V = 3 V + 6 V 

The total power loss and individual resistor power losses are: 

    Pₜₒₜ = IVᵢₙ = (0.003 A) (9 V) = 0.027 W = 27 mW 
    (Pₜₒₜ = I²Rₜₒₜ = (0.003 A)² (3000 Ω) = 0.027 W = 27 mW)
    P₁ = I²R₁ = (0.003 A)² (1000 Ω) = 0.009 W = 9 mW 
    P₂ = I²R₂ = (0.003 A)² (2000 Ω) = 0.018 W = 18 mW 

The larger resistor dissipates twice as much power.

For the 10 Percent Rule, you can go to the Example10.txt
in actual practice, the computed value of the bleeder resistor does not always come out to an even value.
Since the rule of thumb for bleeder current is only an estimated value, the bleeder resistor can be of a 
value close to the computed value. (If the computed value of the resistance were 500Ω, a 5 percent 510Ω
resistor could be used. See the standard resistor values table in the front matter of the book.)  Once 
the actual value of the bleeder resistor is selected, the bleeder current must be recomputed. The voltage
developed by the bleeder resistor must be equal to the voltage requirement of the load in parallel with
the bleeder resistor. We’ll discuss voltage dividers, as well as more complex divider arrangements, in the
section on resistors in Chap. 3.
