Like Thevenin’s theorem, it takes a complex two- terminal network and replaces it with a simple 
equivalent circuit. However, instead of a Thevenin voltage source in series with a Thevenin
resistance, the Norton equivalent circuit consists of a current source in parallel with a
resistance—which happens to be the same as the Thevenin resistance. In essence, Norton’s theorem 
is to current sources as Thevenin’s theorem is to voltage sources.
