In Sec. 2.5, we saw that the current density within a copper wire increased as the diameter of
the wire decreased. As it turns out, a higher current density translates into a hotter wire; 
there are more collisions occurring between electrons and copper lattice ions. There is a point
where the current density can become so large that the vibrating effect can overpower the 
copper- lattice binding energy, resulting in wire meltdown (also referred to as the fusing point).
TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURING, IT IS IMPORTANT TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE WIRE SIZE FOR ANTICIPATED
CURRENT LEVELS. Wire size is expressed in gauge number—the common standard being the American Wire
Gauge (AWG)—whereby a smaller gauge number corresponds to a larger- diameter wire  (high current
capacity). Table_wire_gauges shows a short list of common AWG wires. Section 3.1, on wires and cables, 
provides a more in- depth list.
