Example: Why shouldn’t you connect a wire across a voltage source? For example, if
you connect a 12- gauge wire directly across a 120- V source (120- V mains outlet), what
do you think will happen? What will happen when you do this to a 12- V dc supply,
or to a 1.5- V battery?

(answer):

1 mil = 0,0254 mm
80 mil = 2,032 mm

then we get the Area of the wire:

    Awᵢᵣₑ = 2,032 * 2,032 = 4,129024

the distance between positive to negative will say 0,5 meters
    
    Lwᵢᵣₑ = 500 mm

and now the wire is a copper wire which is has internal resistance: 

    ρ_copper = 1.72 x 10⁻⁸ ΩM
    ρ_copper = 1.72 x 10⁻⁵ Ωmm

now the internal resistance is

                  L                     (500 mm)
    R = ρ_copper ―――― = (1.72 x 10⁻⁵) ―――――――――――――― = 0,002 Ω   
                  A                     4,129024 mm 

now you connect it to the 120-V source:

         V    120
    I = ――― = ――――― = 60 KA !!!!!!!!
         R    0,002

12-Gauge wire could handle 9,327 A, this 60 KA will melt down your wire

In the 120- V mains case, you will likely cause a huge spark, possibly melting the wire and
perhaps in the process receiving a nasty shock (if the wire isn’t insulated). But more likely,
your circuit breaker in the home will trip, since the wire will draw a huge current due to its
low resistance—breakers trip when they sense a large level of current flowing into one of their
runs. Some are rated at 10 A, others at 15 A, depending on setup. In a good dc supply, you will
probably trip an internal breaker or blow a fuse, or in a bad supply, ruin the inner circuitry.
In the case of a battery, there is internal resistance in the battery, which will result in 
heating of the battery. There will be less severe levels of current due to the internal resistance
of the battery, but the battery will soon drain, possibly even destroying the battery, or in an
extreme case causing the battery to rupture (pecah / putus).
