A 10-Ω heating device is powered by a 120- VAC source. How much current
does it draw, and what size conductors should be used to connect to the device?

(answer):

120 VAC is an RMS value of a sinusoidal voltage—in this case, household line voltage.
Though we’ll discuss this later when we cover ac, it can be treated like a dc voltage
in terms of power dissipated through a resistor. So,

V = 120 Vₐc
R = 10Ω 

              V²    120²    14400
    P = VI = ―――― = ――――― = ――――――― = 1440 W
              R      10       10

         P      1440
    I = ―――― = ―――――― = 12 A
         V      120
        
A 10- gauge wire would support this kind of current, though a larger 8- gauge wire
would be safer.
