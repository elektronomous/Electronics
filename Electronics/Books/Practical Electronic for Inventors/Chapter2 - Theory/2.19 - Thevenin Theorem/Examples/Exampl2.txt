find the current in the 4 Ω using thevenin theorems (Image2.PNG).

R₁ = 10 Ω
R₂ = 4 Ω
R₃ = 5 Ω
R₄ = 5 Ω

first you need to remove the 4 Ω to create the terminal and where you can determined 
the Vthev. Because the two sources are different sources, then we use the KVL immediately:
    
    V - IR₁ - IR₃ - IR₄ = 0

because the R₂ is disconnected, then the loop start from 20 V to R₄ 5 Ω. If you pull the arrow point
of the I sources, then the current will be opposite direction with the I in the R₄ and thats why the 
current in the R₄ is I + 2:

    V - IR₁ - IR₃ - (I+2)R₄ = 0
    V - IR₁ - IR₃ - IR₄ + 2R₄ = 0
    V = IR₁ + IR₃ + IR₄ - 2R₄
    20 = 10I + 5I + 5I - 2 (5)
    20 + 10 = 20I
    30 = 20I
    I = 3/2 = 1.5 A 

to find the Vthev, you're using the KVL again:

    Vthev - IR₃ - IR₄ = 0
    Vthev = IR₃ + IR₄ 
          = 10I = 10(1.5) = 15 V 

to find the Rthev, sort the voltage and open the current sources. You left with the R₃ and R₄ in series is parallel with R1:

    Rthev = (R₃ + R₄) || R₁
          = 10 || 10 = 5 Ω

Now reconnect the R₂ again and find the I₂:

           Vthev      15
    I₂ = ――――――――― = ―――――― = 3 A 
         Rthev + R₂    5
