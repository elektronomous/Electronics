Find the Vthev, Rthev and the current flowing through the 3 Ω
in the circuit (Image1.PNG)

R₁ = 3 Ω
R₂ = 6 Ω
R₃ = 12 Ω

first you need to remove the 3 Ω, then create two terminal from there. from this you created the Vthev.
Because this circuit has two sources, we need to use KVL.

Loop I:

    Vthev - IR₂ + V" = 0
    Vthev = IR₂ - 35
          = 6I - 35

You can use the current from the other Loop (Loop II) for calculate the equation I above:

Loop II:

    Rtot = R₂ + R₃ = 12 + 6 = 18 Ω

         V     42
    I = ――― = ――――― = 2,33 Ω
         R      18

back to the first equation: 

    Vthev = 6I - 35 = 6(2,33) - 35 = 14 - 35 = -21 V

Now to find the Rthev you need to short the voltage, and we left with the R₂ and R₃ in parallel:

    Rthev = R₂ || R₃
        = (R₂ x R₃) / (R₂ + R₃)
        = 72 / 18
        = 4 Ω 

Now reconnect the R₁ into the terminal and we can calculate the current that passed through it: 

          Vthev         -21 
    I = ――――――――――― = ――――――――――― = -7 A (the current direction is ⬸)
        Rthev + R₁      4 + 3
