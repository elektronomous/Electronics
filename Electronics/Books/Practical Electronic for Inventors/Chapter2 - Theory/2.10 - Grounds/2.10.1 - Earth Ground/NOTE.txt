The correct definition of an earth ground is usually a connection terminated at a rod driven into
the earth to a depth of 8 ft or more. This earth ground rod is wired directly to a mains breaker
box’s ground bar and sent to the various ac outlets in one’s home via a green- coated or bare 
copper wire that is housed within the same mains cable as hot and neutral wires. The ground can
then be accessed at the outlet at the ground socket. Metal piping buried in the earth is often 
considered an earth ground. See Image1.PNG.

A physical link to the earth is important because the earth provides an electrically neutral body;
equal numbers of positive and negative charges are distributed through its entirety (keseluruhan). 
Due to the earth’s practically infinite charge neutrality, attempts at changing the earth potential,
via electrical generators, batteries, static electrical mechanisms, or the like, will have 
essentially no measurable effect.

Any introduction of new charge into the earth is quickly absorbed (the earth’s moist soil is usually
rather conductive). Such charge interactions occur constantly throughout the planet, and the exchanges
average out to zero net charge

For practical purposes, then, the earth is defined to be at a zero potential (relative to other things)
—a potential that is practically immune to wavering(keraguan). By connecting various pieces of electronics
equipment to the earth ground, they can all share the earth’s ground reference potential, and thus all
devices share a common reference.

The actual physical connection to earth ground at a particular piece of equipment is usually through the
power cord’s ground wire (kabel ground pada colokan) that links to the mains ground wire network when the device
is plugged in (read for the first paragraph of this section to connect what you read). The ground wire from the
power cord is typically connected internally to the equipment chassis (frame) and, more important for our 
discussion, to the return portion of a channel that emanates from the interior circuitry.

                channel that emanates from the interior circuitry

This is then brought out as a ground lead terminal. For example, in Circuitry_example.PNG, an oscilloscope,
function  generator, and generic audiovisual device use BNC and UHF connectors for input and output channels. 

The important part, now, is that the return, or outer, connector is also internally wired to the mains ground
wire through the power cord cable. This sets the return to an earth ground reference. In the case of the dc
power supply, a separate earth ground terminal is presented at the face in the form of a banana jack terminal.
In order to ground the dc supply, a jumper wire must be connected between the negative supply terminal and the
ground terminal. If no jumper is used, the supply is said to be floating.

All the grounded pieces of equipment share a common ground. To prove this to yourself, try measuring the 
resistance between the ground terminals of any two separate pieces of test equipment in your lab. If the devices
are properly grounded, you will get a measurement of 0 Ω (but a bit more for internal resistances).

Besides acting simply as a reference point, grounding reduces the possibility of electrical shock if something
within a piece of equipment should fail and the chassis or cabinet becomes “hot.” If the chassis is connected to
a properly grounded outlet via a three- wire electrical system(live, neutral, ground) ground, the path of current
flow from the hot chassis will be toward ground, not through your body (which is a more resistive path). A ground
system to prevent shock is generally referred to as a dc ground. We’ll discuss shock hazards and grounding later,
when we cover ac.

Grounding also helps eliminate electrostatic discharge (ESD) when a statically charged body comes in contact with
sensitive equipment. The charged body could be you, after a stroll(berjalan-jalan) you took across the carpet. Some
ICs are highly vulnerable to damage from ESD. By providing a grounded work mat or using a grounded wrist strap while
working with sensitive ICs, you can avoid destroying your chips by ensuring that charge is drained from your body
before you touch anything. (see Working ground mat or wrist.PNG)
