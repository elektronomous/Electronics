The correct definition of an earth ground is usually a connection terminated at a rod driven into
the earth to a depth of 8 ft or more. This earth ground rod is wired directly to a mains breaker
box’s ground bar and sent to the various ac outlets in one’s home via a green- coated or bare 
copper wire that is housed within the same mains cable as hot and neutral wires. The ground can
then be accessed at the outlet at the ground socket. Metal piping buried in the earth is often 
considered an earth ground. See Image1.PNG.

*rod = batang besi
*piping = pipa selokan / perpipaan
*8 ft = 2,43 meters

A physical link to the earth is important because the earth provides an electrically neutral body;
equal numbers of positive and negative charges are distributed through its entirety (keseluruhan).
