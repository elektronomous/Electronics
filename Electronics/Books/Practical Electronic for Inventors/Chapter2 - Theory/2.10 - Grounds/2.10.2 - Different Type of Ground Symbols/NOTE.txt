To avoid misinterpretations regarding earth grounding, voltage references, and current
return paths, less ambiguous symbols have been adopted. (See Image1.PNG shows an earth
ground (could be Earth or reference), a frame or chassis ground, and a digital and 
analog reference ground.) See tableground.PNG
