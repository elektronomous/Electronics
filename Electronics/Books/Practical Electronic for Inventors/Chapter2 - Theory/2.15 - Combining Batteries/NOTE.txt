The two battery networks in Image1.PNG show how to increase the supply voltage and/or increase the supply
current capacity. To increase the supply voltage, batteries are placed end to end or in series; the 
terminal voltages of each battery add together to give a final supply voltage equal to the sum from the
batteries. To create a supply with added current capacity (increased operating time), batteries can be 
placed in parallel—positive terminals are joined together, as are negative terminals, as shown in
Image1.PNG.

Note: When placing batteries in parallel, it’s important that the voltages and chemistry be the same—choose
all similar batteries, all fresh. If the voltages are different, you can run into problems.
