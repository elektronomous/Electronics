Alternating voltages applied across a resistor will result in alternating current through the resistor that
is in phase with the voltage, as seen in Image1.PNG. a sinusoidal waveform generated by a function generator
can be mathematically described by:

        V(t) = Vp sin(2π × ⨏ × t)       ....(2.24)

where VP is the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage waveform, f is the frequency, and t is the time. 
Using Ohm’s law and the power law, you get the following:

                V(t)     Vp 
        I(t) = ―――――― = ――― = sin (2π × ⨏ × t)
                 R       R  

If you graph both V(t) and I(t) together, as shown in Fig. 2.86, you notice that the current and the voltage
are in phase with each other. As the voltage increases in one direction, the current also increases in the 
same direction. Thus, when an ac source is connected to a purely resistive load, the current and voltage are
in phase. If the load isn’t purely resistive (e.g., has capacitance and inductance), it’s a whole different
story—more on that later.

To find the power dissipated by the resistor under sinusoidal conditions, we can simply plug the sinusoidal
voltage expression into Ohm’s power law to get an instantaneous power expression:

                V(t)     Vp² 
        P(t) = ―――――― = ―――― sin² (2π⨏t)
                 R        R 

Expressing voltage, current, and power in an instantaneous fashion is fine, mathematically speaking; however,
in order to get a useful result, you need to plug in a specific time—say, t = 1.3 s. But how often do you need
to know that the voltage, current, or power are at exactly t = 1.3 s? Better yet, when do you start counting?
These instantaneous values are typically inconvenient for any practical use. Instead, it is more important to
come up with a kind of averaging scheme that can be used to calculate effective power dissipation without 
dealing with sinusoidal functions.

Now, you might be clever and consider averaging the sinusoidal voltage or current over a complete cycle to get
some meaningful value. However, the average turns out to be zero—positive and negative sides of waveforms cancel.
This may be a bit confusing, in terms of power, since the positive- going part of the wave still delivers energy,
as does the negative- going part. If you’ve ever received a shock from 120- V line voltage, you’ll be able to
attest(membuktikan) to that.

The measurement that is used instead of the average value is the RMS or root mean square value, which is found by
squaring the instantaneous values of the ac voltage or current, then calculating their mean (i.e., their average),
and finally taking the square root of this—which gives the effective value of the ac voltage or current. These
effective, or RMS, values don’t average out to zero and are essentially the ac equivalents of dc voltages and 
currents. The RMS values of ac voltage and current are based upon equating the values of ac and dc power required
to heat a resistive element to exactly the same degree. The peak ac power required for this condition is twice 
the dc power needed. Therefore, the average ac power equivalent to a corresponding average dc power is half the 
peak ac power.

Mathematically, we can determine the RMS voltage and current values for sinusoidal waveforms 
V(t) = Vp sin (2π × f × t), and I(t) = IP sin (2π × f × t):

        Vrms =   ⎮ ―    | V(t)² dt = ―――― × Vp = 0.707 x Vp             .... RMS Voltage

        Irms =   ⎮ ―    | I(t)² dt = ―――― × Ip = 0.707 x Ip             .... RMS Current 
                ⎷ T  ⁰ ⎭             √2 


Notice that the RMS voltage and current depend only on the peak voltage or current—they are independent of time 
or frequency. Here are the important relations, without the scary calculus:

                Vp     Vp 
        Vrms = ―――― = ―――――― = 0.707 x Vp               Vp = Vrms × 1.414 
                √2     1.414


                Ip     Ip 
        Irms = ―――― = ―――――― = 0.707 x Ip               Ip = Vrms × 1.414 
                √2     1.414

For example, a U.S. electric utility provides your home with 60 Hz, 120 VAC (in Europe and many other countries 
it’s 50 Hz, 240V AC). The “VAC” unit tells you that the supplied voltage is given in RMS. If you were to attach an
oscilloscope to the outlet, the displayed waveform on the screen would resemble the following function:

        V(t) = 170 V sin (2π × 60 Hz × t), where 170 V is the peak voltage.

With our new RMS values for voltage and current, we can now substitute them into Ohm’s law to get what’s called ac
Ohm’s law:

        Vrms = Irms × R

Likewise, we can use the RMS voltage and current and substitute them into Ohm’s power law to get what’s called the
ac power law, which gives the effective power dissipated (energy lost per second):

                          V²rms  
        P = Irms × Vrms = ――――― = I²rms × R
                            R
Again, these equations apply only to circuits that are purely resistive, meaning there is virtually no capacitance 
and/or inductance. Doing power calculation on circuits with inductance and capacitance is a bit more complicated,
as we’ll see a bit later.

Image5.PNG shows the relationships between RMS, peak, peak- to- peak and halfwave average values of voltage and 
current. Being able to convert from one type to another is important, especially when dealing with component maximum
voltage and current ratings—sometimes you’ll be given the peak value, other times the RMS value.
