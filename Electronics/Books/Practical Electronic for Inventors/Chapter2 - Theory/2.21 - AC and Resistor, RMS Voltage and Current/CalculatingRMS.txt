* We know that DC voltages/current never change its direction, at every instance 
  it's almost remain constant and hence when calculating power, voltage, and current
  is very easy in DC. (Image2.PNG)

  for example: say that you have a battery (10 volts) and a lamp that needs 2 amperes
               current for work. then the power it's use at any instance of time is:

                    P = I V = 20 W

* Now we have AC that its voltage and current is change direction over time. See the
  Image3.PNG, from beginning we have 0 V, in the next few seconds we get 5V, to 10 V
  back again to 5V and 0V and the reach the negative side of the voltage and current. 
  Now if you use the peak value of 10V or -10V or 5V or -5V for calculating the power
  you'll get wrong answer because the next few seconds the voltage and current is keep 
  changing over time. We need a term for which will give us the effective value of AC
  quantities which we can consider for power calculation and which will remain true for
  the most of the time. The step for calculating this effective value is (Peak value in
  this example is 20V):

  1. Divide the waveform in equal section (Image4.PNG) and mark the value as 
     shown (Image5.PNG):
        V₁ = 6.2 V
        V₂ = 11.8 V
        V₃ = 16.2 V
        V₄ = 19 V
        V₅ = 20 V
        V₆ = 19 V
        V₇ = 16.2 V
        V₈ = 11.8 V
        V₉ = 6.2 V
        V₁₀ = 0 V
    
     * Now if you wonder why we only use the half cycle, you can also use one cycle 
  
  2. Take the square of each voltages:

        V₁ = 6.2 V      => 38.44
        V₂ = 11.8 V     => 139.24
        V₃ = 16.2 V     => 262.44
        V₄ = 19 V       => 361
        V₅ = 20 V       => 400
        V₆ = 19 V       => 361
        V₇ = 16.2 V     => 262.44
        V₈ = 11.8 V     => 139.24
        V₉ = 6.2 V      => 38.44
        V₁₀ = 0 V       => 0
  
  3. Take the average/mean of the marked values:

        38.44 + 139.24 + 262.44 + 361 + 400 + 361 + 262.44 + 139.24 + 38.44 + 0
        ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
                                        10
        
        = 200
  
  4. Simply take the square root for the final value: 

        √200 = 14.14 V RMS


* This 14.14 V RMS AC is equivalent to the 14.14 VDC. For example if you have 10 V RMS
  AC and a bulb that needs 2A for work, then the power is: 

        P = IV = 20 W

* For calculating size of cable you can considering the RMS current measurement
* For calculating size of the insulator in high voltage AC applicationi, the peak value shall
  be considered rather than RMS value. 
* RMS value, peak value, average value will change with different waveforms (sine wave, square wave,
  and triangular wave)
