Example1: How much current would flow through a 100-Ω resistor connected across the hot and neutral 
          sockets of a 120- VAC outlet? How much power would be dissipated? What would the results
          be using 1000-Ω, 10,000-Ω, and 100,000-Ω resistors?

               Vrms   120
        Irms = ―――― = ――― = 1.2 A 
                 R    100

        Pₐᵥₑ = Irms × Vrms = 120 V × 1.2 A = 144 W

First, don’t try this with any ordinary resistor; you’d need a power resistor or special heating element 
with a power rating of greater than 144 W! (Also, simply don’t attempt attaching a resistor with the outlets
powered.) A 1000-Ω resistor plugged into the same outlet would dissipate 14.4 W; a 10,000-Ω resistor would
dissipate 1.44 W; a 100,000-Ω resistor would dissipate 0.14 W.

Example2: What is the peak voltage on a capacitor if the RMS voltage of a sinusoidal waveform signal across 
          it is 10.00 VAC?

          Vp = Vrms × 1.414 = 14.14 V

Example3: A sinusoidal voltage displayed on an oscilloscope has a peak amplitude of 3.15 V. What is the RMS
          value of the waveform?

          Vrms = Vp × 0.707 = 2.23 V

Example4: A 200- W resistive element in a heater is connected to a 120- VAC outlet. How much current is 
          flowing through the resistive element? What’s the resistance of the element, assuming it’s an ideal 
          resistor?

          Pₐᵥₑ = 200 W
          Vrms = 120 VAC
                 
                 V²rms            (120)²           14400
          Pₐᵥₑ = ―――――     200 =  ――――――    200 = ―――――――    R = 72 Ω
                   R                R                R

Example5: A sinusoidal voltage supplied by a function generator is specified as 20 V peak to peak at 1000 Hz.
          What is the minimum resistance value of a 1⁄8-W resistor you can place across the generator’s output
          before exceeding the resistor’s power rating?

          Vpp = 20V,    Vp = ½ × Vpp = ½ × 20 V = 10 V    Vrms = 0.707 × Vp = 7.07 VAC 

          Pₐᵥₑ = ⅛ W

                 V²rms            (7.07)²           49.9
          Pₐᵥₑ = ―――――       ⅛ =  ――――――      ⅛ = ―――――――    R = 400 Ω
                   R                R                R
          
Example6: The output of an oscillator circuit is specified as 680 mVAC. If you feed this into an op amp with an
          input resistance of 10 MΩ, how much current enters the IC?

          Vrms = 680 mVAC = 680 / 1000 = 0.68 VAC
          R = 10 MΩ

          Irms = Vrms / R = 0.68 / 10_000_000 = 68 nA 

MEASURING RMS VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS
you can still get a fairly accurate idea of the RMS value of a sine waveform, knowing one of the other measurements
such as the half- wave average, peak, or peak- to- peak value. This can be done by calculation, or using the table 
in Image7.PNG. As you can see, it’s also possible to work out the RMS value of a few other symmetrical and regular
waveforms, such as square and triangular waves, knowing their peak, average, or peak- to- peak values.

An important thing to note when using the table is that you need to knowthe exact basis on which your meter’s 
measurement is made. For example, if your meter measures the peak value, and then calculates and displays the 
equivalent sine wave RMS figure, this means you’ll need to use the table differently when compared to the situation
where the meter really measures the half-wave average and calculates the sine wave RMS figure from that. So take
care, especially if you’re not sure exactly how your meter works.
