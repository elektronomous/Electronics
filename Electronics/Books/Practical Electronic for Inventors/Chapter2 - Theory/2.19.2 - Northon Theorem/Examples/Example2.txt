Find the current in the 4 Ω resistor using Northon Theorem (Image3.PNG)

R₁ = 8 Ω
R₂ = 6 Ω
R₃ = 2 Ω
Rload = 4 Ω

= first you need short the 4 Ω resistor, you get the analysis by looking at
  the Image3_analysis.PNG. 
    
    Inorthon = I₁ + I₂ .........(1)

to find the I₁:

    I₁ = V₁ / R₁ = 42 / 8 = 5,25 A

to find the I₂, we're using the current divider formula:

            R₃
    I₂ = ――――――― . I = 0,75 A
         R₃ + R₂

I₂ is a current that's go through the 6 Ω (R₂)
now we get the Inorthon = 6A 

to find the Rnorthon, it's like the find the Rthevenin by short all the voltage sources, 
and open the current sources. We end up with 

    Rnorthon = R₁ || (R₂ + R₃)
             = 8 || (8) = 4 Ω

now re-place the 4 Ω:

                Rnorthon
    Iload = ―――――――――――――――     . Inorthon = 3A  
             Rnorthon + Rload
