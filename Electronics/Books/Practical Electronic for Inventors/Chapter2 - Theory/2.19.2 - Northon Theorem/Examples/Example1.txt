find the current in the 3 Ω resistor of the circuit below.

If you short the 3 Ω resistor, it will be the path that's the lowest resistance 
in the circuit. That's why the direction of the current will go through this path.

from Image2.PNG we get our calculation:

    I_N = I + I₁ - I₂........(1)

now find the I:

    I = V / R = 6 / 2 = 3A 

now find the I₁:

    I₁ = V₁ / R₁ = 4 / 1 = 4A 

now find the I₂:

    I₂ = V₂ / R₂ = 5 / 1 = 5A

now we can substite those three values to our first equation:

    I_N = 3 + 4 - 5 = 2 A

to get the Rnorthon, we need to open the circuit (I_N in the Image2.PNG) and short the
voltage, we end up with all of the resistors are parallel:

    Rnorthon = R₂ || R₁ || R
             = (1 || 1) || 2
             = 0.5 || 2
             =  0,4 A

now re-place the 3 Ω resistor, the current go through the load resistor is: 

            Rnorthon                0,4 Ω
    I =  ――――――――――――――   . I_N = ――――――――― . 2 A = 0,235 A  
         Rnorthon + Rload           3,4 Ω
