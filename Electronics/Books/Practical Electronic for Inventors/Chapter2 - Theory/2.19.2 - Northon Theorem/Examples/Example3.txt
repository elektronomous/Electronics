find the current in the 8 Ω resistor using Northon Theorem (Image4.PNG)

R₁ = 5 Ω
R₂ = 20 Ω
R₃ = 4 Ω

because both theorem is involving the superposition theorem, you can remove
one of the sources and find the I in each of the sources:

as usual first we short the 8 Ω. Now open the 3 A circuit and find the current
that goes through all the circuit: 

    R' = R₁ + (R₂ || R₃)
       = 5 + (20 || 4)
       = 8,33 Ω
    
    I' = V / R = 25 / 8,33 = 3,001 A

    In' = (20 / 20 + 4) * I' = 2,5 A

now short the voltage, and recalculate the current: 

    R"left = (5 || 20) = 4 Ω
    Rtot = (4 || 4) = 2 Ω
    
    I" = 4 / (4 + 4) * Isources = 1.5 A

now you get the Inorthon = 4A (look at the direction of the current, that's why we add them together)
find the Rnorthon by open the 8 Ω, open the 3A and short the voltage: 

    Rnorthon = (5 || 20) + 4
             = 8 Ω
    
    Iload = (8 / 8 + 8) * Inorthon =  = 2 A
