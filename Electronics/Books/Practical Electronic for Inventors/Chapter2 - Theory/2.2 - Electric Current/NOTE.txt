Electric current is the total charge that passes through some cross- sectional area A per
unit time. This cross- sectional area could represent a disk placed in a gas, plasma, or
liquid, but in electronics, this cross- sectional area is most frequently a slice through a
solid material, such as a conductor.

If ∆Q is the amount of charge passing through an area in a time interval ∆t, then
the average current Iₐᵥₑ is defined as (Image1.jpg):

        Iₐᵥₑ = ΔQ / Δt

The unit of current is coulumbs per second, but this unit is called the ampere(A), named after
Andre-Marie Ampere:

        1 A = 1 C/s

Because the ampere is a rather large unit, current is also expressed in
    • milliamps (1 mA = 1 x 10⁻³ A),
    • microamps (1 μA = 1 x 10⁻⁶ A), and
    • nanoamps (1 nA = 1 x 10⁻⁹ A)

Within conductors such as copper, electrical current is made up of free electrons moving through a
lattice of copper ions. Copper has one free electron per copper atom. The charge on a single 
electron is given by:

    Qₑₗₑcₜᵣₒₙ   =             (-e) = -1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C
    Qₑₗₑcₜᵣₒₙₑ  =   -6.24 x 10¹⁸ e = 1 C

The loss of the electron means there is one more proton per atom than electrons. The charge of a
proton is:

    Qₑₗₑcₜᵣₒₙ   =               (-e) = +1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ C
    Qₑₗₑcₜᵣₒₙ   =   +6.24 x 10¹⁸ e   = 1 C

so there's +/-6.24 x 10¹⁸ C in 1 A in 1s.

How do we get a negative number of electrons flowing per second, as our result indicates? 
The only two possibilities for this would be to say that :
    • either electrons must be flowing in the opposite direction as the defined current, or 
    • positive charges must be moving in our wire instead of electrons to account for the sign.
    (
        The last choice is an incorrect one, since experimental evidence exists to prove electrons
        are free to move, not positive charges, which are fixed in the lattice network of the 
        conductor.

What does this (Image2.jpg) mean to us, to those of us not so interested in the detailed physics and
such? Well, not too much. We could pretend that there were positive charges moving in the wires and
various  electrical devices, and everything would work out fine: negative electrons going one way are 
equivalent to positive charges going in the opposite direction. 

In a nutshell, it’s convenient to pretend that positive charges are moving. So when you see the term
electron flow, make sure you realize that the conventional current flow I is moving in the opposite
direction.

What’s considered a lot or a little amount of current? It’s a good idea to have a gauge
of comparison when you start tinkering with electronic devices. Here are some examples: 
a 100- W lightbulb draws about 1 A; a microwave draws 8 to 13 A; a laptop computer, 2 to 3 A; an 
electric fan, 1 A; a television, 1 to 3 A; a toaster, 7 to 10 A; a fluorescent light, 1 to 2 A; a
radio/stereo, 1 to 4 A; a typical LED, 20 mA; a mobile (smart) phone accessing the web uses around
200 mA; an advanced low- power microchip (individual), a few µA to perhaps even several pA; an 
automobile starter, around 200 A; a lightning strike, around 1000 A; a sufficient amount of current
to induce cardiac/respiratory arrest, around 100 mA to 1 A.
