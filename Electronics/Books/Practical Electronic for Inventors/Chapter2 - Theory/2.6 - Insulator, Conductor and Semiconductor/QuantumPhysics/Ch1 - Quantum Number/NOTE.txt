electrons are both particles and waves (if you don't understand go watch the double-slit experiments).

the location and energy of every electron in an atom is determined by a set of 4 quantum numbers that
describe different atomic orbitals.

an orbital is a region of probability where an electron can be found. there are s, p, d, f orbitals 
with different shapes and they look like (Orbitals.PNG)

These shapes(Orbitals.PNG) are not electrons, just regions in space where electrons can be and each one
can hold up to two electrons.

The more electron an atom has, the more of these orbital it will need to accommodate(Menampung) them all.

the first quantum number is the principal number  = 1,2,3, ... (any positive integer value) => Bohr Model
atom show the atom shell. this principal number is represents the energy level of the electron. each orbital
will have n value and the larger the value of n the further away from nucleus it is.

the second quantum number is the angular momentum quantum number ℓ (ell) = 0, 1, 2, ... (n-1). For the
example if the electron has n = 3, so the ℓ = 0, 1, 2. This ℓ value describe the shape of the orbitals:
    • when ℓ = 0, we're describing the 's' orbital => look at the s_Orbital.PNG
    • when ℓ = 1, we're describing the 'p' orbital => look at the p_Orbital0.PNG
    • when ℓ = 2, we're describing the 'd' orbital => look at the d_rbital0.PNG
    • when ℓ = 3, we're describing the 'f' orbital => look at the f_rbital0.PNG

for the magnetic quantum numbers mₗ (m sub ℓ) = -ℓ..ℓ, for example if ℓ = 2, then mₗ can be mₗ = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.
This magnetic quantum numbers determines how many orbitals there are of a type per energy level and therefore
describes specific orbitals amongst a particular set.

the last quantum number is the spin quantum number mₛ (m sub s). It's either mₛ = +½ [↑] or -½ [↓]. Every electron has unique
set of quantum numbers, no two electrons in an atom can have precisely the same four  quantum numbers(n, ℓ, mₗ, mₛ) as
stated by Paulie Exclusion Principle. This is because any orbital can only hold up to two electrons, and even the two
electrons in the same exact orbital will have opposite values(one would be +½ and the other -½). Let's try to find the
means of the four quantum numbers

(1) n = 1;  => atom that has only one energy level
    ℓ = 0;
    m = 0;
    => This means we're describing the 1s orbital. It can accomodate two electrons which will have spins of half and
       one negative half. (1s_Orbital.PNG).

(2) n = 2; => atom that has only two energy levels / two shells 
    
    ℓ = 0  => means 2s orbital, mₗ = 0;
    or ℓ = 1; means 2p orbital, mₗ = -1, 0, 1;

    => This means we're describing the 2s and 2p orbitals. It can accomodate 8 electrons (2 electrons in 2s and 2 electrons
       in each of the 2p orbital) which will have spins of half and one negative half. 

(3) n = 3; => atom that has three energy levels / three shells 
    ℓ = 0; => means 3s orbital, mₗ = 0
    ℓ = 1; => means 3p orbital, mₗ = -1, 0, 1
    ℓ = 2; => means 3d orbital, mₗ = -2, 1, 0, 1, 2
    => this means we're describing the 2s, 2p and 3d orbitals. It can accomodate 18 electrons

There's a Aufbau principle where tells us the order on how to put electrons in energy level (Aufbau_principle.PNG).
For example, chlorine has 17 electrons, the configuration is :
(1) you put 2 electrons in 1s [↑↓]
(2) you put 2 electrons in 2s [↑↓] and 6 electrons in 2p [↑↓][↑↓][↑↓]
(3) you put 2 electrons in 3s and now we left with 5 electrons.
    = We have rule again here called Hund's rule that says for electrons of the same energy you put one electrone in each 
      orbital first ([↑][↑][↑])before doubling up([↑↓][↑↓][↑])
    = you can see the Chlorine.PNG
(4) we get the configuration of the Chlorine => 1s²2s²2p⁶3s²3p⁵
    2s²

    |||________ how many electrons in that energy level
    ||_________ the orbital
    |__________ is energy level / atom shell 

=> we're conclude here that the quantum number 'n' tells you how many shells the atom has, 'ℓ' tells you the type of the orbital
   it could be (s, p, d, f orbital), and the MOST IMPORTANT the mₗ tells you the probability of the where the electrons are orbiting
   theirself in mₗ (for example mₗ = 5 (-2, 1, 0, 1, 2), then electrons is orbiting in 5 way) form way.
