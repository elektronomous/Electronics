        P ≡ VI

The generalized power law tells us how much power is pumped into a circuit but doesn’t say
anything about how this power is used up. Let’s consider a two- lead black box—an unknown
circuit that may contain all sorts of devices, such as resistors, lamps, motors, or 
transistors(Image1.PNG). If all we can do is measure the current entering the black box and
the voltage across it—say, using an ammeter and voltmeter (or singularly, a wattmeter)—we 
could apply the generalized power law, multiply the measured current and voltage readings 
together, and find the power pumped into the black box. 

Knowing how much power is pumped into the black box is incredibly useful—it allows for quick
power consumption measurements and often simplifies circuit analysis—as we’ll see later. But
let’s say that we are interested in figuring out how much power is lost to heating (energy 
that goes into lattice vibrations, emissive radiation, etc.). We really can’t say, assuming 
we aren’t allowed to look inside the black box. There could be devices inside that take some
of the initial energy and use it to do useful work, such as generating magnetic fields in the
armature (rotor) and stator sections of a motor, causing the stator to rotate; or generating 
a magnetic field in a voice coil attached to a paper speaker cone that compresses air; or 
generating light energy, radio waves, and so on. There may be power converted into other weird
forms not really coined(membikin) as heat, such as driving chemical reactions, generating 
hysteresis effects, or eddy current in transformers.

The only time we can say for certain that power is totally converted into heat energy is if we
assume our black box is a perfect resistor (100 percent ohmic in nature). Only then can we 
substitute Ohm’s law into the generalized power equation:

        P = VI = V(V/R) = V² / R
or
        P = VI = (IR)I = I²R

In this form, the power lost due to heating is often called Ohmic heating, Joule heating, or I²R
loss. Be careful how you interpret this law. For example, let’s consider our black box that drew
1 W of power. Given the power and the current—which we measure—it would be easy to assume that the
resistance of the black box is:

        R = P / I² = 1 W / (0,01A) = 100 Ω

Accordingly, we would say the black box is a 100-Ω resistor generating 1 W of heat. As you can see,
this is an erroneous(keliru) assumption, since we have disregarded the internal workings of the black box—we
didn’t account for devices that perform useful work. You’ll often see people treat any load 
(black box) as a resistor when doing circuit analysis and such. This will get you the right answer 
when solving for a particular variable, but it is an analysis trick and shouldn’t be used to determine
how much heat is being generated, unless, of course, the black box is actually a resistor.

The following example provides some insight into where power is being used and how much of it is being converted into heat.

Example: With an ammeter and voltmeter, you measure the current drawn by a computer to be 1.5 A and the 
voltage entering to be 117 V. How much power does the computer consume? Can we say how much power is 
lost to heat?

(Answer:) 
        P = IV = (1.5 A)(117 V) = 176 W. 
Knowing how much of the power is lost to heating is practically impossible to measure without taking the computer apart.

Example: Determine the resistance of the following four round rods of material, each 1 m long and 2 mm in 
diameter: copper, brass, stainless steel, and graphite. Also figure out how much power is lost to heating 
if a current of 0.2 A flows through each one.

(answer): Using Eq in 2.5.2

          A
    ρ ≡ R ⎯ 
          L
        
          L      L          1 m                 1
    R = ρ ― = ρ ――― = ρ ―――――――――――――― = ρ ――――――――――――― = ρ (3.18 x 10⁵ m⁻¹) 
          A     πr²     π (0,001)² m      3.14 x 10⁻⁶ 

using Image1.PNG in 2.5.2:
ρ_copper    = 1.72 × 10−⁸ Ωm, 
ρ_brass     = 7.0 × 10−⁸ Ωm, 
ρ_steel     = 7.2 × 10−⁷ Ωm, 
ρ_graphite  = 3.5 × 10−⁵ Ωm

Substituting those into the resistance expression, we get

Rcopper     = ρ_copper (3.18 x 10⁵)     = 1.72 x 10⁻⁸ * (3.18 x 10⁵)    = 5.48 x 10⁻³ Ω
Rbrass      = ρ_brass (3.18 x 10⁵)      = 7.0 x 10⁻⁸ * (3.18 x 10⁵)     = 2.23 x 10⁻² Ω
Rsteel      = ρ_steel (3.18 x 10⁵)      = 7.2 x 10⁻⁷ * (3.18 x 10⁵)     = 2.31 x 10⁻¹ Ω
Rgraphite   = ρ_graphite (3.18 x 10⁻⁵)  = 3.5 x 10⁻⁵ * (3.18 x 10⁵)     = 11.1 Ω 

the power loss we get by using P = I²R = (0,2A)²R = (0,04 A)R:

Pcopper     = 0,04 * 5.48 x 10⁻³ Ω = 2.2 x 10⁻⁴ W
Pbrass      = 0,04 * 2.23 x 10⁻² Ω = 8.9 x 10⁻⁴ W
Psteel      = 0,04 * 2.31 x 10⁻¹ Ω = 9.2 x 10⁻³ W 
Pgraphite   = 0,04 * 11.1 Ω = 0.44 W
