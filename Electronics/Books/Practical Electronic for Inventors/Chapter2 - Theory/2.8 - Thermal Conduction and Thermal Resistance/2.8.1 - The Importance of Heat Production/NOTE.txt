Heat production has its place in electronics (toasters, hair dryers, water heaters, etc.),
but most of the time heat represents power loss that is to be minimized whenever possible,
or at least taken into consideration when selecting components.

All real circuit components—not just resistors but things like capacitors, transformers, 
transistors, and motors—contain inherent internal resistances. Though these internal 
resistances can often be neglected, in some situations they cannot be ignored.

Major problems arise when unintended heat generation increases the temperature of a circuit
component to a critical point, causing component failure by explosion, melting, or some 
other catastrophic(bencana) event. Less severe (parah) problems may surface as a component
becomes thermally damaged, resulting in a change in characteristic properties, such as a 
shift in resistance that may cause undesirable effects in circuit behavior.

TO AVOID PROMBLES ASSOCIATED WITH HEAET PRODUCTION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE COMPONENT THAT ARE
RATED TO HANDLE TWO OR THREE OR MORE TIMES THE MAXIMUM POWER THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE.
IN CASES WHERE HEAT PRESENTS A SHIFT IN COMPONENT PARAMETER PERFORMANCE, SELECTING A COMPONENT
WITH A LOWER TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT (TC) WILL HELP.

Heat dissipation (more correctly, the efficient removal of generated heat) becomes very 
important in medium- to high- power circuits—power supplies, amplifier stages, transmitting
circuits, and power- hungry circuits with power transistors. There are various techniques to 
remove heat from a circuit in order to lower the operating temperature of components to below 
critical levels. Passive methods include heat sinks, careful component layout, and ventilation.
Heat sinks are special devices that are used to draw heat away from temperature- sensitive 
devices by increasing the radiating surface in air—which acts like a cooling fluid for conduction.
Active methods include forced air (fans) or some sort of liquid cooling. We’ll discuss these methods
throughout the book.
