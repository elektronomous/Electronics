Calculate the temperature of a 4- in (0.1 m) piece of #12 copper wire at the
end that is being heated by a 25- W (input power) soldering iron, and whose other
end is clamped to a large metal vise (assume an infinite heat sink), if the ambient
temperature is 25°C (77°F).

(answer):
first, calculate the thermal resistance of the copper wire (diameter #12 wire is 2.053 mm, 
cross-sectional area is 3.31 x 10⁻⁶ m²):

k_copper = 3.937 W/cm °C (look at the Image1.PNG at Section 2.5.2) 
this means that in 1 cm °C = 3.937 W 
                   100 cm °C = W?

                   3.937 * 100 = (1 cm) * W 
                   393.7 = W


             L               (0.1 m)
    ℜₜₕₑᵣₘ = ―――― = ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――― = 76 °C/W
             kA    (393.7 W /(m°C)(3.31 x 10⁻⁶))

             76 C = 1 W

this thermal resistance that own by the copper wire which is 0.1 m. in 1 Watt, the copper could
only transfer heat 76 °C.

Then, rearranging the heat flow equation and making a realistic assumption that only
around 10 W of heat actually is transferred to the wire from the 25- watt iron, we get:

    ∆T = Pₕₑₐₜ ℜₜₕₑᵣₘ = (10 W)(76 °C) = 760 °C

So the wire temperature at the hot end is estimated at:
    25 °C + ∆T = 785 °C

It’s important to realize that in the preceding example, we assume steady- state
conditions, where the soldering iron has been held in place for a long time. Also, the
assumption that only 10 W were transferred is an important point, since there is a lot
of heat being radiated off as heat to the air and the iron handle, and so on. In any case,
things can get very hot, even when moderate power levels are in question.
