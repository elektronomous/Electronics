How does the “chemistry” of the material affect the resistance? For example, if you have
a copper wire with the same dimensions as a brass wire, which metal has the greater overall
resistance? To answer this question, as well as provide a way to categorize materials, we
adopt the concept of resistivity. Unlike resistance, resistivity is entirely independent of 
the dimensions of the material. Resistivity is a property unique to the material. The 
resistivity ρ is defined as follows:

              A
        ρ ≡ R ⎯
              L

where A is the cross- sectional area, 
      L is the length, and 
      R is the overall resistance of the material, as measured across its length.

The units of resistivity are ohm- meters (Ωm). For some, resistivity is too negative a concept—it
tells you how “bad” something is at passing current. Optimists prefer the concept of conductivity—
how “good” something is at passing current. Conductivity, symbolized σ, is simply the mathematical
inverse of resistivity:
                
            1
        σ ≡ ⎯
            ρ

The units of conductivity are siemens, S = (Ωm)−¹. (Mathematical note: [Ωm]−1 = 1/[Ωm]). In terms of
resistivity and conductivity, we can rewrite Ohm’s law as follows:

                   L     I x L
        V = IR = ρ ⎯ I = ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ 
                   A     σ x A

An important feature of resistivity (or conductivity) is its temperature dependency. Generally, within
a certain temperature range, the resistivity for a large number of metals obeys the following equation:
        
        ρ = ρ₀[1 + α(T − T₀)] (2.8)

where ρ is the calculated resistivity based on a set reference resistivity ρ₀ and temperature T₀. Alpha
α is called the temperature coefficient of resistivity, given in units of 1/°C or (°C)−¹

The resistivity for most metals increases with temperature because lattice atom vibrations caused by 
thermal energy (increased temperature) impede the drift velocity of conducting electrons.
