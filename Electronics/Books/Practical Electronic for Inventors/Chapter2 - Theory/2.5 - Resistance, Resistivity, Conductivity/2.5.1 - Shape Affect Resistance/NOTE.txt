The resistance of a conducting wire of a given material varies with its shape. Doubling the length
of a wire doubles the resistance, allowing half the current to flow, assuming similar applied 
voltages. Conversely, doubling the cross- sectional area A has the opposite effect—the resistance 
is cut in half, and twice as much current will flow, again assuming similar applied voltages.

Increasing resistance with length can be explained by the fact that down the wire,there are more 
lattice ions and imperfections present for which an applied field (electric field instigated (dimulai) by 
added electrons pumped in by the source) must shove against. This field is less effective at moving
electrons because as you go down the line, there are more electrons pushing back—there are more 
collisions occurring on average. Decreasing resistance with cross- sectional area can be explained 
by the fact that a larger- volume conductor (greater cross- sectional area) can support a larger 
current flow. If you have a thin wire passing 0.100 A and a thick wire passing 0.100 A, the thinner
wire must concentrate the 0.100 A through a small volume, while the thick wire can distribute this
current over a greater volume.

Electrons confined(yang dibatasi) to a smaller volume tend to undergo a greater number of collisions with other electrons,
lattice ions, and imperfections than a wire with a larger volume. The concentration of free- electron flow,
according to Benjamin Franklin’s convention, represents a concentration of conventional current flow in the
opposite direction. This concentration of current flow is called the current density J—the rate of current
flows per unit area. For a wire: J = I/A. Image2.PNG demonstrates how the current density is greater in a
thin 12- gauge wire than in a thicker 4- gauge wire. It also shows that the drift velocity
