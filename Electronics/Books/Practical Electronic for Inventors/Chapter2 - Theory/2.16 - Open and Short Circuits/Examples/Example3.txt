Example 3: In the parallel circuit in Image3.PNG, loads B, C, and D receive no power when
S2 is closed (assume all other switches are already closed); however, load A receives
power. You notice the fuse is blown. After replacing the fuse, you close S2 with S3 and
S4 open, and the fuse doesn’t blow. Closing S3 power on loads B and C has no effect.
Closing S4 causes B and C to turn off—load D receives no power, either. The fuse is
blown again. What is the problem?

(answer):
The load D is short-circuited
