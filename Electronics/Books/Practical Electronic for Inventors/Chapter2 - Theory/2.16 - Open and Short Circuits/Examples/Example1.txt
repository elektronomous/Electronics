Example 1: In the series circuit in Image1.PNG, determine how much current flows
through the normal circuit (a), then determine how much current flows when there is
a partial short (b), and determine how much current would flow during a full short if
the 1- A fuse weren’t in place. Assume an internal 3-Ω circuit resistance at the moment
of a full- short condition.

(a) Rₜₒₜ = 10 Ω + 1 KΩ + 100 Ω = 1110 Ω
    V = 12v
    I = V / R = 12 / 1110 Ω = 0.01081 A = 11 mA

(b) Rₜₒₜ = 10 Ω + 100 Ω = 110 Ω
    V = 12v
    I = V / R = 12 / 110 = 0.109 A = 109 mA

(c) Rₜₒₜ = Rᵢᵣ = 3 Ω
    V = 12V
    I = V / R = 12 / 3 = 4 A - FUSE BLOWS
