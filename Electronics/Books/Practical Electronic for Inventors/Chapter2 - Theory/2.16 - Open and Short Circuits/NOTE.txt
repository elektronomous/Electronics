A short circuit in all or part of a circuit causes excessive current flow. This may blow a fuse or
burn out a component, which may result in an open- circuit condition. An open circuit represents a
break in the circuit, preventing current from flowing. Short circuits may be caused by a number of
thingsâ€”from wire crossing, insulation failure, or solder splatter inadvertently linking two separate
conductors within a circuit board. Figure 2.59 shows cases of open- and short- circuit conditions. A
fuse, symbolized ~, is used in the circuit and will blow when the current through it exceeds its 
current rating, given in amps.

To prevent short circuits from destroying circuits, various protection devices can be used, such as
fuses, transient voltage suppressors, and circuit breakers. These devices sense when too much current
is flowing, and they will blow or trip, thus creating an open- circuit condition to limit excessive
current damage.
