An electric circuit is any arrangement of resistors, wires, or other electrical components (capacitors, 
inductors, transistors, lamps, motors, etc.) connected together that has some level of current flowing
through it. Typically, a circuit consists of a voltage source and a number of components connected 
together by means of wires or other conductive means. Electric circuits can be categorized as series 
circuits, parallel circuits, or a combination of series and parallel parts. See Image1.PNG and Image2.PNG
